## Context
As of 2020, 6.7 million people reside in Victoria, Australia's second most populated state. Most of them, 5 million, live or work in Melbourne, state's capital. During 2020 Australia was among the first to close international borders, followed by a closure of interstate borders. Victoria introduced some of the strictest pandemic-related restrictions on business activity that resulted in a significant portion of its population working from home.
We have combined this data with the stock price of AGL, Victoria's largest electricty provider, to see the impact of consumption on their stock price.

## Description

The dataset covers 2016 days between 1 January 2015 and 6 October 2020. During some intraday intervals RRP was negative, so that energy producers were paying consumers rather than wise versa. Below is a brief description fo the data:

- date : datetime, the date of the recording
- demand : float, a total daily electricity demand in MWh
- RRP : float, a recommended retail price in AUD$ / MWh
- demand_pos_RRP : float, a total daily demand at positive RRP in MWh
- RRP_positive : float, an averaged positive RRP, weighted by the corresponding intraday demand in AUD$ / MWh
- demand_neg_RRP : float, an total daily demand at negative RRP in MWh
- RRP_negative : float, an average negative RRP, weighted by the corresponding intraday demand in AUD$ / MWh
- frac_at_neg_RRP : float, a fraction of the day when the demand was traded at negative RRP
- min_temperature : float, minimum temperature during the day in Celsius
- max_temperature : float, maximum temperature during the day in Celsius
- solar_exposure : float, total daily sunlight energy in MJ/m^2
- rainfall : float, daily rainfall in mm
- school_day : boolean, if students were at school on that day
